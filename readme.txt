This project demonstrates how to create a responsive timetable using HTML and CSS. The timetable is designed to display schedules in a structured and organized manner.
It features columns for days of the week and rows for time slots.
There is use of appropriate HTML tags, like <table>, <thead>, and <td>,that ensures the content is structured logically for both users and screen readers.
